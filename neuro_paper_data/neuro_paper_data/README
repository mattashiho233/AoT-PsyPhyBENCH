Due to licensing issues, we share the id of the data in the Moments in Time (MIT) dataset instead of sharing the raw video data. 

To prepare the data for the experiments, please:
1. Download the MIT dataset. 
2. Use the conversion table json file under this dir to fetch the 212 video files. 
3. Reverse them, resulting in 424 video files. 
4. Name them exactly as the conversion table json indicates.
